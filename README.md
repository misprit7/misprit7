- 🚀 [Firmware for a rocket going to space](https://github.com/UBC-Rocket/Whistler-Blackcomb-v2)
- ⚡ [Flight computer PCBs for the rocket](https://github.com/UBC-Rocket/WB-AV-4500-FC)
- 🕴️ [A custom made PCB business card with a fully functioning microcontroller](https://github.com/misprit7/PCB-Business-Card)
